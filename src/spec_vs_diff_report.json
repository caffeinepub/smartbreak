  "summary": "Diff adds a SmartBreak landing-page component set (Hero/Problem/Solution/How-It-Works/Technology/Simulation/Impact/About/Contact), basic in-view entrance animations, smooth-scroll usage in Hero/Header, and a backend method to create/list contact submissions. However, backend upgrade persistence is not implemented, some section headings/step text do not exactly match spec, and the backend includes additional user-profile/access-control features that were not requested.",
